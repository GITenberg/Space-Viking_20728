description: When his wife is murdered on his wedding day, Lucas Trask launches himself
  on a quest for revenge. Using his personal fortune, he buys a spaceship and becomes
  a Space Viking, raiding worlds while hunting for his wife's killer. But raiding
  is not his destiny, and he gradually becomes a trader, starting to build a galactic
  empire. Before he can achieve his new goals, however, he must still deal with his
  wife's killer.
